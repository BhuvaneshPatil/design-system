# Radius & shadows

Radius is an important part of a design system that brings consistency across experiences and platforms. Good typography rules help present content clearly and efficiently.

## Border Radius

To optimize the global consistency, all elements with a corner radius are standardized at 4px.

**‣**  Buttons <br/> <br/>
**‣**  Filters <br/> <br/>
**‣**  Tables <br/> <br/>
**‣**  Content container <br/> <br/>
**‣**  Dropdown <br/> <br/>

## Drop shadows

Like the border radius, we only have one type of shadow.

We use it on 3 differents cases : <br/> <br/>
**‣**  On the content containers (in addition with the border below) <br/>
**‣**  On the Filters : To make them more visible <br/> 
**‣**  On the dropdown panel & Popups : <br/> 

## Table & Content container border

In addition to the drop shadow we add a slighty border on the table, dropdown, popup, helpbox and every other elements we want to highlight or make pop over the interface.
