# DatePicker

This is the doc of the `DatePicker` component

## DatePicker

Date pickers help users selecting a specific date from a calendar. They can be associated to a Time picker component.  

**Best practices**

- When the date picker is clicked, it takes today's date.
- It is not possible to write the date from the keyboard.
- It is not possible to change the date format.
- A Date picker can used simultaneously with a Time picker in a form.
- The PopOver closes after selecting a date.
- One single format of date is currently available.
- The Date picker is built on top on a Field component.

## Usage

A date picker is used to select an unique date. It's not possible to select a date range. A date picker can have a null value via the Clear feature. A navigation via the keyboard is possible within the calendar PopOver, however it's impossible to write a date from the keyboard. 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="base">
    {() => {
      const [date, setDate] = useState();
      return (
        <div>
          <DatePicker
            onChange={setDate}
            selectedDate={date}
            label="Date picker"
            name="datepicker"
            clearLabel={'Clear the datepicker'}
            onClear={() => setDate(undefined)}
            selectedDateLabel={(formattedDate) => `Date picker, current is ${formattedDate}`}
          />
          <div style={{ marginLeft: '500px' }}>
            <button>Button outside picker</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
