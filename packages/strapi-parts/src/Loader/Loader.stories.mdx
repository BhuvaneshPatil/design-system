# Loader

Loaders indicate some data is currently loading where content usually takes place. They help to notify users that loading is ongoing.

**Best** **practices**

- Once the content appears, the loader disappears.
- If the trigger only concerns a portion of a page, the loader should be placed in that part.
- Loaders should be scaled down if they aimed to be placed in a small portion of a page.
- Use a loader whenever the wait time is to be longer than 1 second.


## Usage

Even if loaders give an indication that an action has been processed, they do not provide details about what is happening on the back-end side. 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="base">
    <Loader>Loading content...</Loader>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Loader} />
