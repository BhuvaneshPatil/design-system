# Loader

Loaders indicate some data is currently loading where content usually takes place. They help to notify users that loading is ongoing.

**Best** **practices**

- Once the content appears, the loader disappears.
- If the trigger only concerns a portion of a page, the loader should be placed in that part.


## Usage

Loaders shows an action has been processed. Moreover, details about what is happening should be provided even if visually hidden.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="base">
    <Loader>Loading content...</Loader>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Loader} />
